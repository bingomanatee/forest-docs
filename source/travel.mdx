# Travel: a case study

Going from here to there -- and bringing your stuff with you -- has been evolving for millennia. But this has
not always been "for the better."

## Tradeoffs

The more carefully your data is managed, the more expensive it is to retain - both in update speed, money, and
the cost to educate yourself as to how to participate and access it.

Consider the transportation paradigm. Originally, everyone walked everywhere. You learned this skill as an infant and
while walking was slow, it was easy and easily managed. Then people started riding horses. Faster, harder, but easier to
transport not only you, but you, a friend, and maybe a little cargo.

Then people tossed on a cart. You could take a whole lot of stuff, but it required cartmakers, tackle, and maybe
wasn't quite as fast but it was great for business.

Then the industrial revolution happened. Trains increased cargo transport speed and capacity, but you had to lay tracks
and stay on tracks, and this could create exploitable bottleneecks for people who wanted to take your cargo or stop it
from getting to its destination. It also placed transport in the hands of the train owners and created a whole commercial
bottleneck.

Meanwhile shipping became so prevalent that the concept of moving things from one place to another became synonymous
with the name of an oceangoing vessel.

Cars happened, and the freedom to travel and transport was returned to the masses. Also, transport was once again
useful as offensive platforms in war. But instead of maintaining a relatively small number of engines, you had to
expand industry to provide sales and service to every family who wanted a car -- essentially every family.

And once people realized how fast cars could go, watching cars go fast became a sport unto itself.

As engines became more effective, you got motorcycles, the ultimate one-man vehicle, that traded safety for flexibility
and speed. (and coolness). And bicycles. technically you probably could have made bicycles in the Bronze age, but the
benefits of industrial development made them practical and effective.

Not long after that people decided they didn't just want to go "over" they wanted to go "up". Plane transport gave
unparalleled reach, speed and comfort, and again, another dimension of warfare. Ultimately, "up" became out of this world
and we shot for the moon. Having discovered that it was sadly not made of cheese, we opted for satellites and exporation
robots.

Along the way telecommunication allowed us to transmit _ideas_, in some cases obviating the need for physical transport,
and allowing for better documentation and observation of physical commerce and collaboration. And we ended up having
heart attacks because we became fat and lazy because we stopped walking anywhere.

### Improvements

If you graph the gains and losses, you find some things generally increasing: speed, cargo capacity, and the ability
to reach places at greater and greater distance. Or, decreasing (in a good way): the cost to transport the same goods,
or the ability to transport larger and larger goods, as in, the ability to make the statue of liberty in France and
ship it to America, or the ability to support wars or commerce on a far larger scale than could have been accomplished
in previous eros.

There were costs though.

### Expense

Walking is for the most part free, safe, and requires no training. Going to the moon in a rocket or taking a helicopter
is expensive, dangerous, and requires a highly skilled specialist to not only get you there but to make and maintain
the vehicle you use. This is true even if you only want to go ten blocks over.

The faster you want to go, the more specialized and expensive your fuel (and other consumables) are. Run out of fuel
and your car is no longer taking you places -- you are pushing IT.

### Flexibility

The more sophisticated the transport, the more limited it is in getting to specific places. Roads, and in some cases
specialized tracks, must be laid. The more sophisticated the transport, the more limited it is to specific
paths or locations; the most extreme being planes, which for the most part only travel between fixed airports.

Even cars require parking; and in some environments that is not only expensive but time-consuming.

### Risk

And cars, well, they crash, Rocket ships explode. Planes fall out of the sky. Trains run off the tracks.
High speed transportation is dangerous -- and sometimes fatal. The worst case scenario of this is 9-11. The thing
we thought was a friendly transportation device was turned into a weapon that killed 5,000 people and started a war.

Buses may have created a low-cost transportation device -- but they also mash a lot of strangers in a confined space,
which is an excellent way to spread disease.

And of course, the faster a system of transportation is, the easier it is to kill yourself -- or others -- with it.
The most extreme example is the motorcycle: fast, flexible, and relatively inexpensive, it is the best alternative to
growing old you ca get.

### Cost
<Callout>
  This of course prompts engineers to build in safety features, further bloating the const and weight of the vehicle.
  And that's how we end up with a vehicle frequently taking a single person from point A to B that weighs several tons
  and can cost over half a years' salary to purchase.

And the more sophisticated the system of transport becomes, the more expensive it becomes; at this point the vehicle
may be the single most expensive thing you ever buy, and if it isn't, its definitely the second most expensive thing.
And the cost of fuel can make or break the economy. it's so extreme that in some cases people decide its better to live
in their cars than to pay rent and use public transportation.

### Why it matters

<Callout>
  Given the time overhead of parking - a non-issue with scooters, they can be hands down the fastest point to point transport
  in metropolitan areas.
</Callout>
Transportation went from being something we as a society just didn't think about much or spend much money on,
to the defining characteristic of modern civilization - one that might in fact be the cause of the end of human civilization
completely.

This is the natural insane end of _over-engineering_. It may also be considered the result of _bad engineering_:
choosing the wrong priorities and engineering to solve for one or two variables without taking the entire ecosystem
into consideration.

For instance, the same technology that we use to get from A to B in a car, we can use to get there in a two-wheeled
scooter. Scooters cost _hundreds_ of dollars, are far more economical, safer (if they are the dominant form of transport)
and more flexible. They may not be appropriate for _all_ your transportation needs, but they are faster than bikes,
easy to learn, compact, and require about the same amount of raw materials, and have far fewer ecological side effects.

Given the time overhead of parking - a non-issue with scooters, they can be hands down the fastest point to point transport
in metropolitan areas.

Bicycles are in the same zone as scooters; faster than walking, but slower than scooters. They often require significant
muscle-power to manage hills, and are in some ways more dangerous, but still they are orders of magnitude lighter,
safer (at least to other people), and more flexible than cars.

Also, they have a very limited military application. (which is a good thing.)

Which is to say, technology is not, inherently, evil or apocalyptic. What is evil, is insanely increasing the scale
and complexity of your solution to maximize a few key metrics, then taking your over-engineered solution and using it
for all possible use cases.

## State Systems

Browser state systems are all "Consumer grade" tools -- faster and in many ways more flexible than industrial transport
systems, they trade off safety features for utility. However I'd suggest that Redux kind of jumps the shark; it's
closer than you would like to a motorcycle, fast, but with a lot of opportunities to hurt yourself.

Forest aims to be more of a car: a little heavier than a cycle but with clear safety features that give you
far more control over your experience.
