# Subscriptions

Subscriptions are exposed only on Forests; you cannot at this point subscribe to leaf values.
They follow the Rxjs Subscription pattern.

`myForest.subscribe(onChange)` can be passed a function -- 99% of the time that is fine. But it also
accepts the more complex `{next(value){...}, error(err){..}, complete() {}}` form that is part of the
RxJS API.

## The tempo of subscription

Subscriptions are as quiet as possible:

* A subscription only emits when _all transactions have completed_
* Errors that occur in a transactional scoped activity will cause cascading failures, ultimately resetting the forest
and its Leaf intstances, to the last committed state, and will _not_ emit to subscribers
* Trapped errors (that is, trapped within the body of an action method) will rollback anything they attempted to do,
but the changes before and after the try/catch code _will_ eventually be sent to subscribers
* Changes that do not change the _real value_ of a Forest will not be emitted.
(replacing an array with an array with the same contents, for instance)

All this is to say, Subscriptions tell you about things that have been done to your forest, as soon as those things
have been determined to be _good things_. Because Forest was coded by a man, it has a fear of commitment; that is,
it isn't going to commit values until all of those values have been validated, and if it fails, its going to throw
all the pending changes into the garbage and quietly storm off.

## Temporary subscriptions

the `.subscribe()` method actually does return a thing: it's a [Subscription](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription) instance,
and you can stop listening through the `.unsubscribe()` method of it.

more than one listener can subscribe to the same Forest, and they can leave when they have had enough.

Note - this system does a thing that is _not_ a healthy production pattern; the state listens to itself, and generates
change based on its own value, which is potentially a recipe for an infinite loop. (another version of this code
had "man bots" and "woman bots" but it got too bulky).

The point here is that the "man child" and "woman child" both listen to the conversation (and react to the other person's
speech) until the woman gets pissed off and kills off her subscription. In a chat type environment you could have
multiple systems subscribing and unsubscribing to your state.
