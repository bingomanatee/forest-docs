# Binding to Subscriptions in React

In general, the `.subsribe` system can be used in the same manner as any RxJS observable, in Angular or any other system.

React of course is special; to bind Forests to React you use hooks.
This is true whether the state is _externally generated_ or _local_.

## Local states

You can easily do local state generation in a component. You then do "unsubscribing" as the "response" of the hook
to eliminate memory leaks.

```javascript
export const CounterComponent = () => {
  // value will be a copy of state.value, immerized.
  // exporting a state's value to a useState property
  // ensures the component re-renders when the state changes
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  // state will be an instance of Forest.
  const state = useMemo(() => {
    return new Forest({
      $value: 0, actions: {
        increase(leaf) {
          leaf.value = leaf.value + 1;
        }
      }});
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    const sub = state.subscribe(setValue);
    // when the document is done,
    // unsubscribing should prevent
    // unnecessary memory leaks
    return () => sub.unsubscribe();
  }, [state, setValue]);

  return (
    <div className={styles['counter']}>
      Count: {value} <button type="button" onClick={state.do.increase}>Add</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here it is, in action:

<CounterComponent />

This may seem like an inconvenient amount of work to just listen to a single numeric change -- but the work
to listen to a forest doesn't change _no matter how large the Forest instance grows_,
or how many actions you write in it.

## Global Stores

Remote / global states are even easier; they can be exported and shared wherever you like.
With global states its even more important to kill off subscribers when components go out of scope.
Also, you may find using contexts to share subscribed values just as effective.

You can have more than one global store if you wish; i.e., one for user, one for cart, one for
product catalog, etc.

```javascript

import userState from './user/state'; // a shared Forest instance

export const UserPanel = () => {
  // pushing subscription to local state hooks
  // ensures the component re-renders when the state changes
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const sub = userState.subscribe(setValue);
    // when the document is done, unsubscribing should prevent
    // unnecessary memory leaks
    return () => sub.unsubscribe();
  }, [state, setValue]);

  return (
    <div>
      User: {value.username} <button type="button" onClick={userState.do.logout} />
    </div>
  )
}

```

"why bother with Forest if we are just leaning on hooks anyway?" Hooks allow us to update our view every time our
state publishes a new value. By bundling (and potentially, expanding locally) our state in a single token, we can
move the state code to a self-contained testable unit, and avoid losing testability in closure, a huge cost of hooks.
We also don't have to write hordes of setters for each property - they automatically get exposed through the forest's
`do` property.

All these examples are as small as possible to emphasize the binding between Forest and React. The economy comes as
you define vastly larger state ecosystems.

## Exposing stores through context

You can use context for transporting global store value down the site:

```javascript

import userState from './user/state'; // userState is a shared Forest instance

export const UserContext = react.createContext({});

export const UserProvider = ({children}) => {
  // pushing subscription to local state hooks
  // ensures the component re-renders when the state changes
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const sub = userState.subscribe(setValue);
    // when the document is done, unsubscribing should prevent
    // unnecessary memory leaks
    return () => sub.unsubscribe();
  }, [state, setValue]);

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{userState, value}}>
      {children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

```

Both the state and its value are imported directly from context, so that subscribers can call actions on the
userState; this makes for easier local testing on components if you want to mock out the state.

## A note on references

In general any state that comes out of a Forest/Leaf instance's value will be unique every time its value is changed -
that includes if a value deep in a sub-sub-object is changed (because, Immer).

Actions, i.e., `myLeaf.do.____` is going to stay the same from render to render,
as if it had been produced by `useCallback`. Unless you _actively_ change a leaf's actions via `.updateDo(true)`; and
even then, only the setter actions will vary from render cycle to render cycle.

So, if you want to add an event handler (i.e., a listener for a click event or a form update or whatever)
to listen to the dom, make it an action and pull out the event's value inside
your forest, and you'll never have to use `useCallback` again.

## Injecting Params into State

There are two (good) ways to inject local state into params:

1. on creation, in the `useMemo` function
2. Through observation, in a `useEffect` hook
3. The not good way, in the body of the render function

If you do 3., you may cause excessive re-renders
