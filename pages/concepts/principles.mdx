# Design Principles

Forest is an attempt to meet _all_ the real world requirements for proper state and application mamagement:

1. proper **control over type** and data
2. **Independent** of any specific view implementation, especially during testing
3. A **single system** for global and component-local state
4. Fault tolerance and **transactional commits**
5. **Synchronous** and observable changes
6. **Composable actions** -- high and low level mutators that can call each other
7. Easy **reuse** of useful design patterns
8. The ability to ***develop quick and readable states**
9. **Conservative broadcast** of updates that only includes fully complete, validated values
10. **Nestable**, flexible systems with actions relative to the root or any particular branch or child node in the system
11. **Fully testable** state systems that do not rely on any specific test framework

Most state systems hit at best half of these items. Forest more or less does them all.

## 1. Control over Types and Data

There is more to data control than type management -- although that is definitely important. You also need to control
the entire _system_. Whether that means ensuring that in a wizard, say, you can only go to the next step when the
current one is complete, _but_ you can navigate to any completed step easily. Or, if you are managing a library, that
a customer can have a maximum of six books in his cart -- less, if he has already checked out other books.

Typescript allows for very flexible but _static_ constraints. A true state system needs to allow for _dynamic_ constraints.
These are functional.

Along these lines, if you can clean up data, its better to do that than to reject it. For instance, if your cart can't
have any empty items, its better to filter out empty slots than to throw an error. Punitive constraints should always
defer to self-healing code that removes bad data without interrupting application flow.

## 2. Independence from specific context

Writing a state system that only operates in a single ecosystem is not only short-sighted; it also means you are likely
going to have issues testing it without constantly spinning up that view system. And, you will always be chasing the tail
of your view systems' updates and breaking changes.

Lastly, there is just no good reason to create dependence. Why limit your audience to a particular tribe? Why, for instance,
disallow your system from being used in server-side systems?

## 3. Usable globally or locally

A good state system can be applied to tactical problems such as an autocomplete widget, as well as a global management
system for (say) user identity and shopping carts. There is no reason to (as was done in Redux) mandate a globally
available provider of state, and to bloat it with all required code for an entire application.

Hooks are great by they by and large are designed for local consumption. This also means that the metabolism of your state
system relies on the view update temp. When I call `setLocalValue(newValue)`, the `localValue` property does not immediately
reflect the new submission. So, you have to wait for a memo to run to reflect the value. And if the view component is removed
from the dom, your new value may _never ever be received_, because the whole context got purged _after_ you requested a change
but _before_ your memoized hooks had a chance to receive it.

A module-provided resource, on the other hand, will survive for as long as the page is not refreshed. This makes it
a much more stable target for mission critical updates.

## 4. Transactional Commits

There is plenty of detail throughout this documentation. In a nutshell, you should be able to bundle a complex series of
operations and roll **all of them back** if a failure condition is triggered. Say you are building an app to position furniture
in a house. You have an `offsetFurniture(x, y)` method that delegates to the furniture's polygon's points' `offset(x, y)`
method.

When all is said and done, _all the points of the polygon must be inside the house_ or the entire `offsetFurniture` method
(and all its side effects) must be rolled back.

In a redux system, if the "offsetPoint" method is called several times, and you inspect the data and find an "out of house"
error, _TOO BAD_ -- not only have you committed the change **permanantly** with no way to retrieve the "last good state"
but you have also updated all the **subscribers** to each point move - the points have been crawling along like a snail,
one by one, which is wierd.

With Transactional control, you can throttle the subscribers' perception of change to only update on the _committed,
verified version_ of the data, no matter how many operations happened within a transactional closure. This is how
databases work, and there is a reason for that.

## 5. Synchronous Change

There is no good reason for change to be delayed, in the context of a single system. You should be able to see the effects
of your changes _immediately_ and use it to make decisions within your procedures. I.e, if your system models a vehicle,
you should be able to write code like this:

```javascript

    class CarState {
      constructor() {
        this.tires = [];
        this.engine = null;
        this.coolingSystem =null;
      }

      isSafe = false;

      get drivable() {
        return this.tires.length === 4 && this.engine && this.coolingSystem;
      }

      runSafetyTest() {
        // simulate car on track
      }
    }

    const car = new CarState();

    car.tires = [{id: 111222}, {id: 111222} , {id: 111222}, {id: 111222}];
    car.engine = {id: 3333};
    car.coolingSystem = {id: 4444};

    if (car.drivable) {
      try {
        car.runSafetyTest();
        car.isSafe = true;
        } catch (err) {
        car.isSafe = false;
      }
    }

```

if on the other hand you had a wierd async system like this:

```javascript

    class CarState {
      constructor() {
        this.tires = [];
        this.engine = null;
        this.coolingSystem =null;
      }

      _engine: null;
      get engine() {
        return this._engine;
      }

      set engine(engine) {
        setTimeout(() => this._engine = engine, Math.random() * 1000);
      }

      isSafe = false;

      get drivable() {
        return this.tires.length === 4 && this.engine && this.coolingSystem;
      }

      runSafetyTest() {
        // simulate car on track
      }
    }

    const car = new CarState();

    car.tires = [{id: 111222}, {id: 111222} ,{id: 111222}, {id: 111222}];
    car.engine = {id: 3333};
    car.coolingSystem = {id: 4444};

    if (car.drivable) {
      try {
        car.runSafetyTest();
        car.isSafe = true;
        } catch (err) {
        car.isSafe = false;
      }
    }

```

well, your car wouldn't be drivable. In fact your engine is in a transitional state. You might try to set the engine,
once you realized that was the problem, again. And due to the randomness of the completion, you never are going to know
for sure what the engine is / will be!

Why do that to yourself? or anyone? State systems should immediately reflect their last set values -- even if that is
done in a transactional closure, it should reflect the pending state, so you can build on your pending work, in real time.

## 6. Compositional methods

Given transactional control you can also _compose_ actions -- and call mutators from other mutators.

## 7. Easy reuse of patterns

It is very difficult to transport part of a Redux system into another context. That is because the actions and the data
exist in totally discrete places, and it is very difficult to take an operation that applies to a sub-part of the reducer
and transport it into another part. This is a consequence of treating the store content itself like a black box.
If your data _and_ the mutators are bundled (as is done in OOP), it is easy to take working concepts from one model
and reuse them in another.

But what about the "Diamond of Sadness" in OOP? well, if you are using compositional design to create and configure your
system, you can choose which "parent bits" to apply, _and_ in which order, _and_ you can override conflicts after the fact.
So there are plenty of opportunities to blend solutions in whatever manner you please.

## 8. Rapid development of readable systems

You should be able to quickly spin up a system and test it - this implies, your system should be containable in a single file,
and it should be relatively easy to read and figure out what is happening. If there is a single quality of Redux that
pisses me off more than any other it is the difficulty of rapid application development. It is so verbose that it encourages
multi-file development, and it has functions that call functions that call functions; further, you have to articulate
setters for each and every property you want to change, and that is just way too much typing.

The more boilerplate in your code, the more difficult it is to pick out the "not boilerplate" (and of course that is
most likely the thing that is "not working", and the reason you are ploughing through it in the first place. )

## 9. Conservative updates of state change

This it the third corner of the triad of compositional actions and transactional control: you should be able to do
many small changes (and see their results) without provoking rendition of the updates until you have completed a cycle
of change. (and validated your work.) This means that your updates to your consumers should be _far more infrequent_
than your activity. In Redux, there is zero difference between a unit of work and emission of updates to consumers.

Incremental work is the foundation of scalable systems. You cannot have performant systems without having control over
the quantity of updates published to expensive consumers. This is the principal behind all the memoization and
callback control in React, and it is a vital criteria for developing responsive applications.

This also means that if you are observing a subset of the state, you should be able to further throttle your updates
to the subset of data you care about. There is no reason to re-render _every_ change when the scope of change is
outside of your selected data. Hooks use dependency arrays for this; components use parameter lists, and that is one of
the reason that HOC is used as the mechanic for Redux. But your system itself should have this capacity, so you can test
for efficient data updates without leaning on your view systems' mechanics.

## 10. Fully testable.

There is no reason for a flight simulator to have wings. You should be able to test your state outside of its consumers;
this is not only faster, it allows you to determine exactly where in the application errors are creeping in.

And its not only a little faster -- it tends to be orders of magnitude faster. Faster tests mean faster development and
faster feedback.
