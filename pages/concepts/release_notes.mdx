# Release Notes

## Major Version Development Notes

### Version 1.x

Version 1.x has a significantly different API, documented [here](https://forest-docs.vercel.app/). It has been
**Thoroughly tested** across several projects and is recommended for those who want a stable secure platform
for production websites.

### Version 2.0

Version 2.0 was re-developed from the ground up. It is more lightweight and its sub-components are better factored
and documented. Specifically:

* The **type sensing** inspection library was moved into `@wonderlandlabs/walrus`
* The **transaction management** system was extracted into `@wonderlandlabs/transact`
* the **universal component access** system was exposed as `@wonderlandlabs/collect` (which also uses walrus).

Not only did this significantly reduce the footprint of the code in Forest itself, but it allowed for more
robust testing of internal components. Splitting up Forest also made the cognitive load of the codebase much lower,
as the anatomy of its ecosystems now has clear boundaries and specialist handlers for the more involved tasks
it requires.

## Roadmap

Right now Forest instances have a hierarchy that is fixed on creation for the most part. This makes some things
relatively simple but doesn't allow for a more dynamic ecosystem. Future releases will address this:

### Dynamic Children

The addition of children is **not** managed transactionally (thus the discouraging of dynamic child addition in
the current codebase). This will, hopefully, be added in future releases, with "join Leafs" allowing for child
addition/creation being subject to rollback. this means also, that leaves will be deletable -- transitionally,
so you can "roll back deletions" if transactions fail.

## Collections

The hierarchical anatomy of leaves preempts some graph-based operations,
and that will be addressable with a collection.
A collection will be a leaf containing IDs of other leaves, that can be updated transitionally.
Other leaves can then join or pick leaves out of a collection leaf by specifying a selector
that filters the collection to the joined element.

This will make modelling concepts like shopping carts easier.
You can create a leaf that contains a collection of product ids
as a child, and those ids can then dynamically expand to product Leaf instances.
Moving from a hierarchy based configuration to a graph-based configuration
will allow for modelling many real-world scenarios.

To make this work at scale, some preprocessing/indexing will allow for more rapid access and traversal
of larger collections.

## Query Syntax

The ability to model selections and mutations as objects allows for easily preprocessed selection and mutation actions.
In combination with `@wonderlandlabs/collect`, you can easily perform operations across a collection, or to a leaf,
can bring some of the power of graphQL's patterns to Forest.
