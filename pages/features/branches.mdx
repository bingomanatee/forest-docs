# Nesting Leafs with Branches

A branch is a sub-leaf that governs the value of one of your leaf's *fields*. its only relevant in object/Map (1)
(compound) value type.

What good is a branch? A branch allows you to:

1. Accomplish the Reducer pattern of redux - one master state with a bunch of tactical states that can intercommunicate
2. use type and test configuration to control the form of a value's field(s).
3. Add local actions to a branch to change sub-fields of a leaf.
4. Add state selectors to more easily create a status/summary of the leaf's branch state.
5. Create reusable leaf components such as field managers that can be managed inside a factory

## Shared transactions

A branch exists within the same transactional bubble as its parent. This means even if you subscribe to and directly
change a branch's value, if the parent is in a transaction, your subscription will be muffled until the parent's
transaction completes.

Branches were used in the [form example, version 2](/get-started/login2) code:

```javascript

export function makeField(title, type, validator) {
  return new Leaf({
      title,
      value: '',
      type,
      touched: false
    },
    {
      setters: true,
      selectors: {
        isValid({ value , touched}) {
          return touched && (!validator(value));
        },
        isEmpty({ value }) {
          return !value
        },
        errors({ touched, value }) {
          if (!touched) return '';
          if (!value) {
            return 'must have a value'
          }
          return validator(value)
        }
      },
      actions: {
        reset(leaf){
          leaf.do.setValue('');
          leaf.do.setTouched(false);
        },
        update(leaf, value) {
          leaf.do.setValue(value);
          leaf.do.setTouched(true);
        },
      }
    });
}

    const login = new Leaf({
        status: 'entering',
        response: null
      },
      {
        branches: {
          username: makeField('User Name', 'text', (value) => {
            if (/[\s]+/.test(value)) {
              return 'username cannot have spaces'
            }
          }),
          password: makeField('Password', 'password', (value) => {
            if (/[\s]+/.test(value)) {
              return 'password cannot have spaces'
            }
            if (value.length < 8) {
              return 'password must be 8 or more characters';
            }
          })
        },
        selectors: {
          isReady({ password, username }) {
            console.log('isValid from', password, username)
            return (password.$isValid && username.$isValid);
          },
        },
        actions: {
          reset(leaf) {
            leaf.next({
              status: 'entering',
              response: null,
            });
            leaf.branch('username').do.reset();
            leaf.branch('password').do.reset();
            leaf.do.setStatus('entering');
          }
        }
      }
    )
```

branches can be directly accessed by name using the `myLeaf.branch('username')` method; however if you want to get
a branches' value, you can access it by name directly off the value of the parent branch:

## changing a branches' value

There are many ways to change a branch's value: (2)

1. *implicitly* via next in the parent leaf: `myLeaf.next({branchName: branchValue})`
2. *implicitly* using the parent leaf's `myLeaf.do.set[BranchName](branchValue)`
3. *directly* using the branch's next method: `myLeaf.branches(branchName).next(branchValue)`
4. *directly* using the branch's actions: `myLeaf.branches(branchName).do.setField(value)`.

## Branch Actions

if you *manually define* a branch's action, you can always use it; however the field setters are *not* automatically
created for branches, to reduce the amount of clutter in deeply nested branches.

There are two ways to enable setters in branches:

1. **globally** by passing the option `{setters: 'all'}` to the root leaf
2. **locally** by passing the option `{setters: true}` to the branch.

You can also "tactically" create a few setters with manual actions.

## Dynamic Branches

The `myInstance.branch(name, newBranch)` method can actually create a new branch. So, if you want to do a database
mirroring leaf, you can write factories for tables or records, and add managed records on the fly.

Branches can also be deleted by calling `myInstance.delKeys(branchName)`. This will both remove the leaf's value in the
parent, and detach the branch from the parent leaf.

use `delKeys` carefully -- if it's used in an action, you will *not* get the branch definition back if a thrown error
reverts the transaction; you will get its value back though. If you need to delete branches often, a "soft delete" may work better;
i.e., create a "deleted" field in the branch and a selector that returns only live branches.

## `parent` and `root` references

A sub-branch can directly access it's parent off the `myLeaf.parent` property. That value will be null for a "root leaf".
the `myleaf.root` property will access the *topmost* parent in a Leaf tree; it will return itself if called from the root leaf.

## Circular Trees

Do not create circular structures by branching a parent leaf into one of its sub-leaves. That is bad and will create
bad things to happen. Leafs in a Leaf tree should all be unique.

------
(1) it might work in the array context as well but hasn't been tested
(2) also, you can call `myLeaf.set(name, value)` on either the branch or the root, with name being the branch's name.
