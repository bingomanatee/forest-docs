## Options

The second property of Leaf can be an object with any/all/none of these properties:

* **name** - an identifier for the leaf. set/overridden for Leaf
  instances made/passed into `.branch(name, value)`
* **test** - a function; will be passed each change, as it is asserted;
  if it returns anything "truthy" (not zero, null, etc), or it throws, will block the updating of a Leaf.
* **actions** - an object of name/function accessible off the `.do` object property of your Leaf.
* **selectors** - a collection of named functions that resolve on each update to return summation of the current value.
* **branches** - an object (or map) of name/branch ( Leaf instances) pairs.
* **type** - if true, then rejects any values that don't match the type (string, number, etc.)
  of the initial value; Also takes one of the type flags:
  - TYPE_STRING
  - TYPE_NUMBER
  - TYPE_DATE
  - FORM_MAP
  - FORM_OBJECT
  - FORM_ARRAY
  - FORM_FUNCTION
  - an array of acceptable types.
* **any** if true, disables ALL type / form checking.
* **debug** - a boolean that if true, will echo extended data; used to develop Leaf code.
* **setters** - boolean, or 'all'; whether to create set[field] actions in the leaf. By default, branches do not
  have setter actions; set root leaf's setters options to 'all' to activate branch actions, or set individual
  branch 'setters' option to true to selectively activate them.
