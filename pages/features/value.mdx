# Leaf's Value

There are no limitations on the Leaf's value - the first argument of the leaf. A leaf's value can be an object, a map,
a string, number, Date, array, or whatever.

<div className="callout">
Objects and Maps will get cloned every time one of their values change; so it's not a good idea to use an object that
relies on its prototype for meaning; for instance putting a DOM object into a Leaf is probably going to be problematic.
</div>

Objects, maps, and arrays are considered **compound** values;
they will(1) get setters inferred for their values in the `.do` method collection.

A leaf's current value is accessed from the `myLeaf.value` property. Do not alter that property directly; use [actions](/features/actions) or `next(newValue)`;

```javascript

const numberLeaf = new Leaf(6);
const stringLeaf = new Leaf('Bob');
const objectLeaf = new Leaf({x: 0, y: 0});
const mapLeaf = new Leaf(new Map([
  ['x', 0],
  ['y', 0]
]));

numberLeaf.next(10);
console.log('new number leaf value:', numberLeaf.value);

stringLeaf.next('Rick');
console.log('new string leaf value: ', stringLeaf.value);

objectLeaf.next({y: 3, z: 6});
console.log('new object leaf value', objectLeaf.value);

mapLeaf.next(new Map([['y', 3], ['z', 6]]));
console.log('new map leaf value', mapLeaf.value);

/**
      new number leaf value: 10
      new string leaf value:  Rick
      new object leaf value { x: 0, y: 3, z: 6 }
      new map leaf value Map(3) { 'x' => 0, 'y' => 3, 'z' => 6 }
*/

```

## `next(value)` - changing the value wholesale

You can update the entire leaf's value with `myInstance.next(newValue)`. For simple values (strings, text, etc.) the
new entry will simply replace the last one. for **compound** values the new fields will be "blended" into the existing
collection. i.e., it will add new properties or update the old ones, but you will never lose properties/map keys
with a next call.

Next, like all of Leaf code, is *synchronous*. Its effects happen immediately after it is called, and is reflected
in `myLeaf.value` and sent out to any [subscribers](/features/subscription) immediately. So, for instance,
inside [actions](/features/actions) you can get the current value of a leaf directly from leaf.value right after
you call `next` (or a setField action, or another action that changes the leaf):

```javascript
     const fibo = new Leaf([1, 2], {
        actions: {
          nextValue(leaf, numberOfValues = 1) {
            for (let i = 0; i <= numberOfValues; ++i) {
              const last = leaf.value[leaf.value.length - 1];
              const prev = leaf.value[leaf.value.length - 2];
              leaf.next([...leaf.value, last + prev]);
            }
          }
        }
      });

      fibo.subscribe(value => console.log('fibonacci series is now ', value));
      fibo.do.nextValue();
      fibo.do.nextValue(5);
      fibo.do.nextValue(2);
      /**
       *
         fibonacci series is now  [ 1, 2 ]
         fibonacci series is now  [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ]
         fibonacci series is now  [
         1,  2,  3,  5,  8,
         13, 21, 34, 55, 89
         ]
         fibonacci series is now  [
         1,  2,  3,  5,   8,  13,
         21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,
         377
        ]
       */

```

Being able to access the current state of the leaf in all contexts makes complex operations a lot easier.

## Keeping the same form

By default, Leaf borks if you change the "form" of a leaf's value. This is because leaf's are intendeded to be nestable,
and a parent leaf should expect any of its branch leafs to be consistent.

```javascript

  const point = new Leaf({ x: 1, y: 2 });
  point.subscribe(value => console.log('value of point', value));
  point.next({ x: 3, y: 4 });
  try {
    point.next('Bob');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('bad form error: ', err);
  }
  point.next({ x: 5, y: 6 });

  /**
   value of point { x: 1, y: 2 }
   value of point { x: 3, y: 4 }
   bad form error:  Error: incorrect form for leaf [ROOT]; wanted Symbol(form:object), got Symbol(form:value)...
   value of point { x: 5, y: 6 }
   */

````

You can disable form checking with the configuration property "any" - but use at your own risk; 'any' in combination
with setters or branches can be unpredictable.

```javascript

const point = new Leaf({ x: 1, y: 2 }, { any: true });
point.subscribe(value => console.log('value of  unguarded point', value));
point.next({ x: 3, y: 4 });
try {
  point.next('Bob');
} catch (err) {
  console.log('unguarded bad form error: ', err);
}
point.next({ x: 5, y: 6 });

/**
 value of  unguarded point { x: 1, y: 2 }
 value of  unguarded point { x: 3, y: 4 }
 value of  unguarded point Bob
 value of  unguarded point { x: 5, y: 6 }
 */

```

## `delKeys(name | names[])`

If you want to actually delete an index, you can pass one or more keys to `delKey` and it will remove them from a compound
object.

```javascript

const objectLeaf = new Leaf({x: 0, y: 0});
const mapLeaf = new Leaf(new Map([
  ['x', 0],
  ['y', 0]
]));

objectLeaf.next({y: 3, z: 6});
console.log('new object leaf value', objectLeaf.value);

mapLeaf.next(new Map([['y', 3], ['z', 6]]));
console.log('new map leaf value', mapLeaf.value);
mapLeaf.delKeys('y');
console.log('new map leaf value without y', mapLeaf.value);

/**
  new number leaf value: 10
  new string leaf value:  Rick
  new object leaf value { x: 0, y: 3, z: 6 }
  new map leaf value Map(3) { 'x' => 0, 'y' => 3, 'z' => 6 }
  new map leaf value without y Map(2) { 'x' => 0, 'z' => 6 }
*/

```
