# Subscription

Leaf's follow RxJS' Observable pattern; you subscribe to their value and receive updates via the listener:

```javascript
const numLeaf = new Leaf(6);
numLeaf.next(7);
const sub = numLeaf.subscribe((value) => console.log('number is now', value));
numLeaf.next(8);
numLeaf.next(9);
numLeaf.next(10);
sub.unsubscribe();
numLeaf.next(11);
numLeaf.next(12);

/**
'number is now', 7
'number is now', 8
'number is now', 9
'number is now', 10
*/
```

Subscribe returns a Subscriber which can be deactivated with `.unsubscrube()`, as shown above.

`subscribe(listener)` also accepts the tri-fold listener as it is a delegation to an 'Rxjs Subject`:

```javascript

myLeaf.subscribe({
  next(value) {
    console.log(value);
  },
  complete() {
    console.log('done')
  }
});

```

## Transactions

All actions and updates are contained within **transactions**. Transactional activity muffles notification to
subscribers. so, for instance, you can write an action and call three or four `myLeaf.setX(2); myLeaf.setY(3)` calls,
and only one update will be emitted.

Even though the changes are actually occurring synchronously, and parent leafs are getting updated, you won't see change in
a listener until the outermost transaction completes.

If you were to do that *outside* an action, several updates will be broadcast. Also, any activity in a transaction with a
thrown error is flushed *completely* including changes that occurred before the error.

```javascript

    const leaf = new Leaf(
      {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        z: 0,
      },
      {
        actions: {
          updateAll(leaf, x, y, z) {
            leaf.do.setX(x);
            leaf.do.setY(y);
            console.log('leafs y is now ', leaf.value.y);
            leaf.do.setZ(z);
            if (typeof y !== 'number') throw new Error('why?');
          },
        },
      }
    );

    leaf.subscribe(value => console.log(value));

    leaf.do.setX(1);
    leaf.do.setY(2);
    leaf.do.setZ(3);

    leaf.do.updateAll(4, 5, 6);
    console.log('---- bad value ----')
    try {
      leaf.do.updateAll(7, '8', 9);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error:', err);
    }
    console.log('current value of leaf: ', leaf.value);

/**
{ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
{ x: 1, y: 0, z: 0 }
{ x: 1, y: 2, z: 0 }
{ x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }
leafs y is now  5
{ x: 4, y: 5, z: 6 }
---- bad value ----
leafs y is now  8
error: Error: why? ...
...
current value of leaf:  { x: 4, y: 5, z: 6 }
*/
```

The same code in action `updateAll()` causes a single update where, if called outside an action, it is three
distinct updates. also even though inside the updateAll leaf is changed to '8', the error thrown *after* all the
values have been 'changed' revert. This is because each leaf is *journaled* for changes, which are reset to the starting
version on any thrown error.

You can manually work inside a transaction by calling `leaf.transact(() => {...})`, but it's easier to just write an
action that does this implicitly.
