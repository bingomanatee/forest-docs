# Selectors

Selectors may superficially appear like actions; however they are designed for a different purpose and connect
to your value differently than actions.

A selector is a function that takes the value and returns a value from it. A typical set of selectors might be
`max`, `round`, `fullName`, etc. They are purely synchronous.

Selectors' values are cached(1) for each version of a leaf. Its assumed they are unique and consistent for each
iteration of the value; so you wouldn't want to use `Math.random()` or absolute time inside a selector.
Selector functions accept the leaf as a whole as the second argument. Mostly this shouldn't be necessary; but
if you want to use shared computation across multiple selectors, you can use (non-value-changing) actions to
derive values inside a selector.

## Selector values

A Leaf's selector values are accessed off of the '$$' property of the leaf, in a map. This is useful for
*non-compound*/ scalar leafs; for instance, as they cannot be combined with the leaf value.

Scalar values are appended to a leaf's value *to subscribers* by name; a "$" is appended to their name
to distinguish them from the fundamental data of a leaf.(2) you can also call `myLeaf.valueWithSelectors()` to get
this combination value directly off the leaf.

## Adding selectors

You can manually add additional selectors with the `myLeaf.addSelector(name, value)` method.

----------

(1) a technical note: leaf's version is *null* during a direct next update; and in that state, selectors are
*not* cached because a leaf value in transition may be updated multiple times as changes feed back from branches.
(2) for this reason, try to avoid using "$"-prefixed fields in a leaf.
