# Leaf `.value` property

The Leaf `.value` property is a passthrough to the `.store.value` property.

_All complex values are passed through immer_. this means:

* subscribed-to values cannot be modified
* a complex value whose content has been modified is _guaranteed_ to be referentially unique
* You cannot depend on any object or array of objects to respect any prototype

That is, if you put an array of `User` instances into Forest2, none of them will pass the `instanceof User` test
after they come out a subscription, or are retrieved from `myForest.value` or the `.value` of any child etc.

**Forest is a store of INFORMATION** -- it is **NOT** a store of references to anything. If you want to store a reference
to a thing, either put it into the `.meta` collection of a leaf or use it in closure or as a parameter to an argument.

## The Store

Every Leaf contains its value in a `@wonderlandlabs/collect` instance, referred to by the `.store` property.
there is a "real" validated store attached to every leaf. However, during transactions, if a transaction
has changed the leaf's value (but has not been committed), the store property may temporarily return a reference
to a "pending" store, attached to the result of a transaction, that will be accepted into the leaf's "real" store
once _all_ transactions have been fully committed.

This means that during transactions, the value of any leaf "in flux" will reflect the "optimistic" value that has
been asserted for it, until all transactions have been flushed.

note, all Leaf actions are also transactions, so in the below documentation, assume "transactions" also includes
setter actions.

## Married With Children

Whichever store is valid at the moment, a clone of it is blended with any child values and that store's value is
returned as the `.value` property of the leaf. This "blended" value is cached. However, the cache is cleared with each
additional transaction, or every time a transaction is rolled back.

## Referential integrity

This means in short, the referential identity of a leaf with changes (or downstream from changed chilldren) will change.
The cloning and updating of an object type value will _not_ respect the parent prototype; Forest, and Leaves, manage and
mutate "plain" objects, and are not safe places to put instances that depend on inherited prototypes
for methods or static properties.

That being said, if a Leaf has not changed, and it has no children, its value shouldn't change from transaction to transaction.
Leaf with children, however, may change referentially due to transactions, even if they have no actual changes; this
overly aggressive updating may be optimized through future releases to be more conservative but at the moment,

the golden rule is, container types (objects, maps, etc.) with children will **definitely change**
after (and during) transactions. Container types without children **may** change if their fields are changed by
transactions.

## Changing value

The most direct way to change a leaf's value is through assignment.

```javascript

const count = new Forest({
  $value: 0
})

count.subscribe(console.log);

count.value = 1;
count.value = 'two';
count.value = 3;

/*
0
1
two
3
 */

```

You can assign objects, maps, etc. directly to the value, and they will be accepted. You can even (dangerously) change
the value to a different type.

However with good constraints, you can limit updates to be specific types. The simplest way to do this is to
constrain acceptable changes to the same type as the initial value:

```javascript

const count2 = new Forest({
  $value: 0,
  type: true
})

count2.subscribe(console.log);

count2.value = 1;
try {
  count2.value = 'two';
} catch (err) {
  console.log('--- error: ', err.message);
}
count2.value = 3;

/**
0
1
--- error:  cannot add value of type string to leaf root (type number)
3

*/
```

You can also assign a named type to `type`: 'string', 'array', 'object', 'number'... or, an array of type strings.
You can also simply set it to `true` to infer type from its initial value.

```javascript

const staticForest = new Forest({
  $value: 0,
  type: ['string', 'number']
});

staticForest.subscribe(console.log);

staticForest.value = 1;
staticForest.value = 'two';
staticForest.value = 3;

try {
  staticForest.value = [4, 5];
} catch (err) {
  console.log('--- error: ', err.message);
}

staticForest.value = 4;

/*
0
1
two
3
--- error:  cannot add value of type array to leaf root (type string or number)
4
 */
```

## Children and assignation

Child values are _asserted upwards_ when assigned new values, and _injected downwards_;
so, there is no way to easily delete the key of a leaf for which a child has been mapped.

By contrast properties that are _not mapped to children_ can be erased through assignment:

```javascript
const { Forest } = require('@wonderlandlabs/forest')

const point = new Forest({
  $value: { x: 0 },
  children: { y: 0, z: 0 }
})

point.subscribe((value) => {
    console.log('---')
    console.log('forest value:', value, 'root local value:', point.localValue);
    console.log('y child leaf value: ', point.child('y').value);
    console.log('z child leaf value: ', point.child('z').value)
});

point.value = { x: 1 }
point.value = { y: 2 }
point.child('y').value = 3
point.value = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 }
point.child('z').value = 'stringy stringy'
/*

---
forest value: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } root local value: { x: 0 }
y child leaf value:  0
z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { x: 1, y: 0, z: 0 } root local value: { x: 1 }
y child leaf value:  0
z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { y: 2, z: 0 } root local value: { y: 2 }
y child leaf value:  2
z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { y: 3, z: 0 } root local value: { y: 2 }
y child leaf value:  3
z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 } root local value: { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 }
y child leaf value:  20
z child leaf value:  30
---
forest value: { x: 10, y: 20, z: 'stringy stringy' } root local value: { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 }
y child leaf value:  20
z child leaf value:  stringy stringy
 */

```

note how the 'x' property disappears after the second assignment because it was not protected by a child,
_or_ present in the assigned value.

At the moment, assigning different **types** of values to a leaf with children creates messy or confusing scenarios;
just don't do it. (best is to set 'type: true' in the config)
You **can** assign different types of values to child leaves, and it will work just fine (unless they have children).

You can also prevent this from happening with type constraints on child nodes.
In this case we are generous with 'z', allowing any scalar,
but specific with 'y', limiting it to its initial type (number).

```javascript
const { Forest } = require('@wonderlandlabs/forest');

const point = new Forest({
  $value: { x: 0 },
  children: {
    y: { $value: 0, type: true },
    z: {
      $value: 0, type: ['number', 'string']
    }
  }
});

point.subscribe((value) => {
    console.log('---')
    console.log('forest value:', value, 'root local value:', point.localValue)
    console.log('y child leaf value: ', point.child('y').value)
    console.log('z child leaf value: ', point.child('z').value)
  });

point.value = { x: 1 }
point.value = { y: 2 }
point.child('y').value = 3
try {
  point.child('y').value = 'four';
} catch (err) {
  console.log('y assignment error:', err.message);
}
point.value = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 }
point.child('z').value = 'stringy stringy'
try {
  point.child('z').value = [4]
} catch (err) {
  console.log('z assignment error:', err.message);
}
/*

```

## Property actions

Object-based leaves will be assigned actions based on their _initial_ profile.

```javascript

const { Forest } = require('@wonderlandlabs/forest')

const point = new Forest({
  $value: { x: 0 },
  children: {
    y: 0, z: {
      $value: 0, type: true
    }
  },
  actions: {
    setAll(leaf, x, y, z) {
      leaf.do.set_x(x)
      leaf.do.set_y(y)
      leaf.do.set_z(z)
    }
  }
})

point.subscribe({
  next(value) {
    console.log('---')
    console.log('forest value:', value, 'root local value:', point.localValue)
    console.log('y child leaf value: ', point.child('y').value)
    console.log('z child leaf value: ', point.child('z').value)
  },
  error(err) {
    console.log('fatal error:', err.message);
  }
})

point.do.set_x(1)
point.do.set_y(2)
point.value = {}
point.child('y').value = 3
point.do.setAll(10, 20, 30)
point.value = {y: ['it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times']}
try {
  point.child('z').value = 'stringy stringy'
} catch (err) {
  console.log('error:', err.message);
}
point.do.set_z(40);
/*
---
forest value: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } root local value: { x: 0 }
y child leaf value:  0
z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { x: 1, y: 0, z: 0 } root local value: { x: 1 }
y child leaf value:  0
z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 0 } root local value: { x: 1 }

z child leaf value:  0
---
forest value: { y: 2, z: 0 } root local value: {}

---

---

  y: [ 'it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times' ],
  z: 30
} root local value: { y: [ 'it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times' ] }
y child leaf value:  [ 'it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times' ]
z child leaf value:  30
error: cannot add value of type string to leaf root:z:9cb75dbd-2b23-4dda-b6a8-bd2ad86a9f8c (type number)
---
forest value: {
  y: [ 'it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times' ],
  z: 40
} root local value: { y: [ 'it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times' ] }
y child leaf value:  [ 'it was the best of times', 'it was the worst of times' ]
z child leaf value:  40
 */

```

Setters are created for both initial properties of the root _and_for initially defined child leaves.
The setter actions when asked to set "x" in set all will update the root value.
The setter actions will directly set children -- if they exist to be set.

## Metadata

If you want to store references to things like dom objects, you must attach them to a leaf as metadata.

Metadata is stored internally as a "map collection". Metadata can be set but never overwritten or modified.
you can access metadata through the `.getMeta(key)` method of any leaf.

Metadata can either be stored with the leaf initially with the `.meta {key: value...}` property of the
configuration, or set at run-time with `.setMeta(key, value)`. Metadata does NOT affect or cause an update
to state value. It is equivalent to the "reference" system of React.

Metadata is not expected to change, once set; if you want to rewrite a meta value you must call `.setMeta(key, value, true)`
to indicate you are intentionally overwriting a meta field.

Some examples of useful things to put in meta:

* Dom references
* Buffers
* Instances from other frameworks (Supabase, SVG.js, etc.)
* Canvas items

Essentially anything that relies on references, prototypes, etc., and that you use in actions but do not directly
include with state.

## Immer integration

[Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) has been fully integrated into Forest.
All complex (non-scalar) values are processed through immer,
when expressed in the `.value` getter of Leaf or Forest instances.

This has the following effects:

1. You cannot modify the value of a Leaf or Forest instance directly by setting properties, adding elements
   to an array, deleting properties, etc.
2. Any time a sub-property or element of a complex value is changed, all parents of the changed value will be
   different references than the previous versions. So, you don't have to worry about "buried" changes to a tree
   structure.

Immer is only used on the outbound value field as a cached snapshot; the actual values in Leafs are standard JS
objects. I.e., you don't need to "immerize" any of your values or use/import Immer for Forest to work for you.
But it also means that complex values you put into Forest will _never be referentially identical to the values you
get out of it._
