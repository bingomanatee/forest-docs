# Using Leaf with React

Leaf was designed to be used with React, as was shown in the getting started examples. There are two ways to
use Leaf in react:

1. **locally** -- as shown in the [getting started](/get-started) examples, you can use useState/useEffect to
  generate a Leaf instance, and pass it (and/or its values) downwards as needed.
2. **globally** -- a leaf can be expressed as a module, that can be accessed from anywhere in your application.
  You can use a root subscriber component to send its values to any downstream components, but there is no reason
  to use properties to access the leaf itself or its methods; you can pull that in from the module system directly.

The latter case is a useful system for, for instance, user login management.

```jsx
import userLeaf from './userLeaf';

export const App = () => {
  import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

  const UserContext = React.createContext(userLeaf.value);

  function App() {
    const [userData, setUserData] = useState(userLeaf.value);
    useEffect(() => {
      const sub = userLeaf.subscribe(setUserData);
      return () => sub.unsubscribe();
    }, []);
    return (
      <UserContext.Provider value={userData}>
        <Content />
      </UserContext.Provider>
    );
  };
}

```

You can also provide the *entire leaf* out of context a la `sub = userLeaf.subscribe((value) => setUserData({value, userLeaf}));`.
note don't send leaf directly out of a context as it doesn't change over time from a referential point of view.
