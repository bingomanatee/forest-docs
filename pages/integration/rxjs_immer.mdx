title: RxJS & Immer
---
## RxJS

Leaf uses, and is intended to work compatibly with, Rxjs. Although a leaf is not a Rxjs class,
it has a Subject signature with the following methods/properties modelled after a BehaviorSubject:

* `next(value)`
* `subscribe(listener)` - delegates to an actual subject listener
* `complete()` - freezes a leaf's update.
* `isStopped` - true after complete.
* `value` -- the current value of the leaf
* `pipe` -- delegates to BehaviorSubject.pipe(1)

One noticeable difference between Leaf and Subjects is that with `next()`; what goes in is not necessarily what
comes out to subscribers. Compound values sent to next()  are *blended*, a la React's setState, with the current value
so you can use partial values to update objects and maps.

Also, (hopefully,) errors in next or actions throw, but do NOT terminate the leaf, instead, rolling back changes
to the previous state with no subscriber notification.

------------

(1) the subject piped out will *not* include selectors. `myLeaf.subscribe(listener)` actually listens to a pipe of the
root subject, which you will be piping from if you call `myLeaf.pipe(....)`. If you must include selectors, call
`myLeaf.subject.pipe(...)`.

# Immer: `LeafImmer`

Leaf is tightly coupled with Immer in a variant class, `LeafImmer`. LeafImmer is identical to the base Leaf class
as far as APIs go; however, it uses immer objects as values for compound data, making them immutable. As such,
it has a slightly narrower value constraint - you can only use immerable values for it.

LeafImmer instances *can* be used as branches for Leaf parents; however it's not recommended to use anything but
LeafImmer instances for LeafImmer branches.
