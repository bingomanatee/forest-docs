import { LoginForm2 } from '../../examples/login/version_2'


The backend team wants to make sure you at least make sure the values don't have spaces in them, and are busy thinking
of more interesting requirements for usernames and passwords; and they want to display errors if the field has been touched.

treating fields as a single value doesn't cut it any more, so you add a branch for each field with custom handling,
and render the input fields around those branches. Luckily you can pass a branch into a component and work on its
local context, and it will still feed back to the parent.
