# Child Leafs

Forest instances are in fact, Leaf instances -- they are the "root" of the Leaf ecosystem. They can be enhanced
with Children to manage specific properties of the root.

While many systems can (and should) be created without child Leaf instances, in some cases it is useful to
transport the actions and value(s) of part of the state into an independent "child" that you attach to the root
(or other Leaf instance).

## Why do you need/want children

Symptoms that you may find child Leaf instances useful are:

* You have several actions which largely or completely concern themselves with a branch of the parent/root
* You often want to subscribe to a branch of the state system
* You want to enforce the same type/filter/test constraints on a series of properties

A classic example, as shown in the [home page](/index) is modelling fields. Every form field has potentially a value
and an error message. In fact, they also have labels, and in some cases options, min, max, inputType, or whatever.

## Parent qualifications

Child leaves are only useful for Leaf instances whose values is of type 'object' or 'map'. Once you have added children
you should not _change the value of the leaf_ to something that is not of that type; its advised to set `{type: true}`
(or `type: 'object'`) in the config of any leaf you intend to use as the parent of child leafs.

## WHEN should you create children

At the moment, children are conceived to be static elements of a state tree, created in the constructor. Future
releases will have more dynamic parent/child structures, collections, and joins, but the current codebase is not tested
around dynamic children.

That being said, there is an `.addChild(<Leaf or leaf config or raw value>, key)` method in the Leaf class which you
can use to after-the-fact bind new data into an existing leaf.

## Conflicts between local values and child values

You can create a Leaf whose value (in the `.$value` property) conflicts with the value of an item in the `.children` pojo.
In all such cases, the child leaf value will express itself over the local value, to subscribers. it is _quite possible_
that in some circumstances the local value will have _incorrect_ (ignored) values for a field that is governed by a child.

When you _set_ a leaf's value with a new value, and that value has fields that are managed by a child, the newly submitted
value should be sent upwards and _overwrite_ the child leaf's entire value.

## adding and removing children

You can -- carefully -- add and remove children through the `leaf.addChild(key, valueOrLeafConfig)` method and the
`leaf.removeChild(key)` methods. Again, this is not thoroughly tested and is not how leaf was designed to operate --
adding and removing children is outside the transactional capacity of Forest to manage, but it can be done.

## Child leaf setter actions

Child Leaf instances can be set by auto-created setters from the `.do` property. This is true not only for the
root leaf, but for any child node within the structure:

```javascript

const rect = new Forest({
  $value: {}, children: {
    ul: { $value: { x: 0, y: 0 } },
    br: {
      $value: {}, children: {
        x: { $value: 10 },
        y: { $value: 10 }
      }
    }
  }
})

rect.subscribe(console.log)

rect.do.set_ul({ x: -10, y: -10 })
rect.do.set_br({ x: 10, y: 30 })
rect.child('br').child('y').value = 50

/*

{ ul: { x: 0, y: 0 }, br: { x: 10, y: 10 } }
{ ul: { x: -10, y: -10 }, br: { x: 10, y: 10 } }
{ ul: { x: -10, y: -10 }, br: { x: 10, y: 30 } }

 */

```

Child leaves should only have one parent and should not be defined as the children for more than one
parent leaf.

## Effects of changing leaf and child values

Setting a new value for a leaf will change the child values of any children for which the new values
have keys. If you set the value of a child leaf directly, it will update its' parent, which will have a chain
reaction up the tree until the root leaf is updated as well.

Any validation/type errors encountered in this process will revoke _all_ the changes, including the attempt
to set the child directly. There may also be other changes rolled back as well, depending on the context,
if the thrown error is not trapped.
