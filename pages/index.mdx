# Forest (formerly Mirror)

Forest is an advanced state engine, targeting React but self-contained and usable in any context
in which you need structured transactional change management.

* Leaf can be uploaded from npm at [@wonderlandlabs/forest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wonderlandlabs/forest).
* Leaf source code is in [github](https://github.com/bingomanatee/forest).

## Primary Features

* The ability to add type-aware schema to your state
* Automatic setter actions for Object/Map Properties
* Actions that can call other actions
* Actions are methods that call methods on the leaf to change values - no "definition" middleware
* Transactional scoping that ensures state reverts to pre-error status on thrown errors
* A simple construction pattern that keeps the full definition of state and change actions in the same place
* Full accessor functions to mutate Leaf structure post-creation, allowing factory functions to alter your Leaf
* Leaf instances be fully tested without instantiating their host view
* Direct integration with Immer for immutable values
* The ability to nest Leaf structures through branches and reuse construction patterns
* Designed to interoperate with RxJs: follows the observable pattern.

## A very simple example

Say you want to create a state that is a simple number, and add a few actions for utility:

```javascript

import {Leaf, isNum} from '@wonderlandlabs/forest';

const myNumber = new Leaf(0, {
  type: true, // blocks new input of a different type than the initial value
  actions: {
    increment(leaf, offset = 1) {
      leaf.next(leaf.value + offset);
    }
  }
});

myNumber.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log('... is now', value);
})

myNumber.do.increment();
myNumber.do.increment(2);
myNumber.next(5);

try {
  myNumber.next('six');
} catch (err) {
  console.log('error: ', err);
}

myNumber.next(7);

/**
* '...is now', 0
* '...is now', 1
* '...is now', 3
* '...is now', 5
* '...is now', 7
*/

```

## An Example with more fun

```javascript

import {Leaf, isNum} from '@wonderlandlabs/forest';

   function point(x, y) {
          return new Leaf({x, y}, {
            branches: {
              x: new Leaf(x, {type: true}),
              y: new Leaf(y, {type: true})
            }
          });
        }

        const box = new Leaf({
              color: 'red'
            },
            {
              branches: {
                topLeft: point(0, 0),
                bottomRight: point(1, 1)
              },
              selectors: {
                width({bottomRight, topLeft}) {
                  return Math.abs(bottomRight.x - topLeft.x);
                },
                height({bottomRight, topLeft}) {
                  return Math.abs(topLeft.y - bottomRight.y);
                },
                area({bottomRight, topLeft}) {
                  return Math.abs(bottomRight.x - topLeft.x)
                    *  Math.abs(topLeft.y - bottomRight.y);
                }
              }
            });

        box.subscribe((value) => {
          console.log('... is now', value);
        });

        box.do.setBottomRight({x: 50, y: 50});

/**
      ... is now { color: 'red', topLeft: { x: 0, y: 0 }, bottomRight: { x: 1, y: 1 }, $width: 1, $height: 1, $area: 1 }
      ... is now {
        color: 'red',
        topLeft: { x: 0, y: 0 },
        bottomRight: { x: 50, y: 50 },
        $width: 50,
        $height: 50,
        $area: 2500
      }
*/

```

The "branches" are sub-leafs whose value is treated like an ordinary field in the root's value.

Selectors are computed fields based on the leaf's value (and that of its branches); its output are prefixed with '$'
to distinguish them from base settable fields.

the "do" property creates automatic change functions for all the leaf's fields, including fields managed by branches
as shown here. You can add custom methods here too.
